# CLIculator

A simple calculator project to learn the ropes of Java, based on https://github.com/Caster/calculator

### Starting off

- V1: a CLI app that asks for two numbers and prints their sum.
  - Keep in mind how you can test your code from the start. Write unit tests.
  - How do you handle invalid input?
  - Try to keep track of your code in Git and keep a clean history.
  - Play around with various methods of reading input and writing output. E.g., System.in/System.out but also System.console. The former can be interacted with in various ways too (InputStream, Reader, etc.).
- V2: a CLI app that asks for one input, parsing e.g. 2+4 and printing the result. Start with only supporting non-negative integers and summation.
  - Keep those unit tests in mind! Does your program also understand 2 + 4?
  - Start with a single addition, then work towards implementing multiple additions such as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.

### Ramping up difficulty

- V3: add subtraction to your V2 calculator. How much code do you need to change?
  - This might also be a good time to implement negative integers.
  - Does your code understand 1 + -2? Should it?
  - Does your code understand -4 -1? Should it?
- V4: add multiplication to your V3 calculator. Be mindful of order of operations! How much code do you need to change?
  - Check that 3 + 2 * 5 = 13, not 25.
  - Does your code understand -3 * -4 = 12 too?
- V5: add division to your V4 calculator. How much code do you need to change?
  - Initially you can have your calculator print 8 / 3 = 3, but it might be nice to have it print something resembling 2.66667.
- V6: add rational numbers to your V5 calculator. How much code do you need to change?
  - Now your calculator should be able to compute that 0.5 * 4 = 2.
